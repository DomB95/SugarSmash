# SugarSmash 
Sugar Smash is a sweet and strategic twist on the classic match-3 puzzle genre, developed in Unity. Designed with a charming, cartoony aesthetic and addictively fun gameplay, Sugar Smash combines candy-matching mechanics with innovative systems like dual-board combat, candy alchemy, and companion evolution.

Players journey through whimsical candy kingdoms, facing off against sugar-coated enemies while crafting powerful boosters and making morality-based choices that shape the story. Whether you’re smashing gummies, fusing flavors, or evolving your candy companions, Sugar Smash is more than just a puzzle — it’s a full adventure.
